# Dino-Comics-Reader

thin ios wrapper app for Dinosaur Comics to extract and display all the alt texts below the page

doesn't do anything fancy, just extracts the text so you don't have to. wraps the HTML as-is.

TODOs include:
* find a code formatter/linter
* let me click on the url in the nav bar and copy the text
* better layout, especially for phone
* TV/Mac support for fun
* cloud sync for bookmark
* favorites
* clone navigation buttons on sides in ipad wide view for touchscreen remote or bluetooth controller
* add auto-migration for old-formatted internal navigation links in news? what was this pattern?
