# Dino-Comics-Reader

thin ios wrapper app for Dinosaur Comics to extract and display all the alt texts below the page

doesn't do anything fancy, just extracts the text so you don't have to. wraps the HTML as-is.

TODOs include:
* favorites (also cloud synced)
* clone navigation buttons on sides in ipad wide view for touchscreen remote or bluetooth controller
* add auto-migration for old-formatted internal navigation links in news? what was this pattern?
* better layout, especially for phone; be able to parse HTML in phone mode...
* add a limit to how many history items are kept
* Add some way to "reject" a remote state update?
* TV/Mac support for fun
