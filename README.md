# Dino-Comics-Reader

thin ios wrapper app for Dinosaur Comics to extract and display all the alt texts below the page

doesn't do anything fancy, just extracts the text so you don't have to. wraps the HTML as-is.

TODOs include:
* opening non-navigation links in external browser
* better layout, especially for phone
* TV/Mac support for fun
